The goal of exampleFLGP is to illustrate the usage of package FLGP with
several examples, including classification problems and regression
problems. R codes for examples in the original paper have been contained
in directory *inst*, including Circles, MNIST and HCP fMRI. Plots and
tables involved reside in sub-directory *plots* and *tables*
respectively. Enjoy our job!
